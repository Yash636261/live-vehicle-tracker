# Real-time Public Transport Tracking App Documentation

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind the Real-time Public Transport Tracking App was to create a solution that could enhance the commuting experience for individuals using public transportation. We aimed to provide a convenient way for users to track the real-time location of buses, trains, and trams, making their daily commute more efficient and user-friendly.

## What it does

The Real-time Public Transport Tracking App is a web application that offers real-time tracking information for public transport vehicles within a city. It allows users to monitor the live locations of buses, trains, and trams, providing valuable information for their daily commute.

## How we built it

### Features

The app was built with the following key features:

- **Real-time Tracking:** Users can track the real-time location of buses, trains, and trams, ensuring they know exactly where their public transport vehicle is.

- **Interactive Maps:** Interactive maps are provided for each type of transport, allowing users to visualize vehicle positions.

- **Vehicle Details:** Comprehensive details about each vehicle, including the next stop and estimated arrival time, are displayed.

- **User-friendly Interface:** The app was designed with a user-friendly interface to ensure a straightforward and intuitive experience.

### Technology Stack

The app was developed using the following technologies:

- **Streamlit:** Streamlit was used as the web app framework to create the user interface.

- **Pandas:** Pandas was employed for data manipulation and analysis.

- **Folium:** Folium was used to generate interactive maps.

## Challenges we ran into

During the development of the Real-time Public Transport Tracking App, we encountered several challenges, including:

- **Data Integration:** Integrating real-time data from public transportation providers and ensuring its accuracy was a significant challenge.

- **Interactive Maps:** Implementing interactive maps that are responsive and easy to use required extensive development and testing.

- **User Experience:** Designing a user-friendly interface that caters to a wide range of users and devices was challenging but crucial.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the following accomplishments:

- Successfully developing a functional app that provides real-time tracking information.

- Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enhances the commuting experience.

- Overcoming data integration challenges to provide accurate real-time information.

## What we learned

While building the Real-time Public Transport Tracking App, we learned:

- How to work with real-time data feeds and integrate them into a web application.

- The importance of user experience (UX) design in ensuring that users can easily navigate and benefit from the app.

- The challenges and complexities associated with developing apps that rely on real-time data.

## What's next for Track-Fast

In the future, we plan to further enhance the Real-time Public Transport Tracking App by:

- Integrating with more public transportation providers to expand coverage.

- Adding features such as predictive arrival times based on historical data and traffic conditions.

- Developing a mobile application version for a seamless experience on smartphones.

- Exploring options for monetization to sustain and grow the project.
